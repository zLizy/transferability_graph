# Model Selection with Model Zoo via Graph Learning
Under review in ICDE 2024

In this study, we introduce **TransferGraph**, a novel framework that reformulates model selection as a graph learning problem. TransferGraph constructs a graph using extensive metadata extracted from models and datasets, while capturing their intrinsic relationships. Through comprehensive experiments across 12 real datasets, we demonstrate TransferGraphâ€™s effectiveness in capturing essential model-dataset relationships, yielding up to a 21.8% improvement in correlatio between predicted performance and the actual fine-tuning results compared to the state-of-the-art methods.
